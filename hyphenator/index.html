"I tell thee again, Gabriel, that&mdash;" But again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends. Nothing was said for some moments, while a succession of riotous waves rolled by, which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling, not heaving it. Meantime, the hoisted sperm whale's head jogged about very violently, and Gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant.

<p class='footer'>This demo uses the <a href='http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/'>Hyphenator</a>
Library. Hyphenator offers support for dynamically modifying the text on your
web page, or even running as a bookmarklet.</p>
